# Purpose

Plan Tracker is a web based application offering client management services to personal trainers  with features to plan their  schedules, store, track, manage client information. 


# Getting Started

Behind Our thought Process for our Final Project 3, Team Power-Haus,  brought our A game. We are showcasing the skills and talents to bring this app to life. We wanted to pick a project idea that we were passionate and in this process we made a full stack application that would solve a problem. Our group’s synergy was in creating an app that would take the organizational work flow to the next level for a trainer in maintaining his clientele. This is the simple overview of the application design, thought process and fruition brought together in one app called PlanTracker.

## Original Idea

\
The idea originally began with Erin Peifer, she is the master mind for this application. 
Web based application for personal trainers to track, plan, schedule, and update their trainees.

Erin Saw a need for personal trainer who was storing client data as individual notes in her phone.
